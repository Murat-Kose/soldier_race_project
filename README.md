Customer Segmentation Project
This project is part of the Machine Learning course and focuses on clustering (customer segmentation) using an unsupervised learning method. The goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.

Project Overview
The project consists of the following tasks:

Mentoring Prep and Self-Study

Import Libraries
Load Dataset
