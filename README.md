# Multi-Class Classification Project

## Overview

This project explores predictive modeling for multi-class classification problems, emphasizing exploratory data analysis, outlier handling, feature engineering, and algorithm implementation.

## Goals

Utilize EDA to uncover insights and prepare data for modeling.
Address outlier detection and feature engineering challenges.
Implement various multi-class classification algorithms.
Compare model performance and select the most suitable approach.

## Steps

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Import necessary libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Load datasets using pd.read_csv()
Perform initial data exploration:
Summary statistics
Visualizations to understand distributions and relationships
Outlier detection and handling
Feature selection and engineering
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values
Normalize or scale features (if needed)
Split data into training and testing sets
Multi-Class Classification:
Import relevant libraries (scikit-learn)
Implement and compare multiple classification algorithms:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forests
XGBoost
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Model Selection and Interpretation:
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics
Interpret results and draw insights
Consider feature importance for understanding model behavior
